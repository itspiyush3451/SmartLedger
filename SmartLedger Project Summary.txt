# SmartLedger Project Summary

## Project Overview
SmartLedger is a full-stack invoicing platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that provides comprehensive invoice management functionality for freelancers and small businesses. The application offers a seamless experience for creating, tracking, and managing various financial documents including invoices, receipts, estimates, and quotations.

## Key Technical Features

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Components**: Created modular, reusable UI components following component-based architecture principles
- **State Management**: Implemented Redux for global state management with appropriate actions, reducers, and selectors
- **UI Framework**: Leveraged Material UI for consistent design language and responsive layouts across devices
- **Form Handling**: Built dynamic form validation for invoice creation with client-side error handling
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporated charts and graphs for financial analytics on the dashboard
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured mobile responsiveness using Material UI Grid system and media queries

### Backend Infrastructure
- **RESTful API**: Designed and implemented a comprehensive API with Express.js following REST principles
- **Data Modeling**: Created MongoDB schemas using Mongoose with proper validation and relationship handling
- **Authentication System**: 
  - JWT implementation for secure token-based authentication
  - Google OAuth integration for simplified user onboarding
  - Middleware for protected route authorization
- **PDF Generation**: Integrated html-pdf to dynamically generate professional PDF documents from HTML templates
- **Email Service**: Configured Nodemailer with SMTP for sending invoice notifications, payment reminders, and receipts

### Database Design
- **MongoDB Collections**: Designed normalized data structure with proper relationships between users, clients, invoices, and payments
- **Indexing Strategy**: Implemented appropriate indexing for query optimization
- **Data Aggregation**: Created MongoDB aggregation pipelines for reporting and dashboard statistics

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Version Control**: Managed development workflow using Git with feature branching strategy
- **Environment Configuration**: Implemented separate development and production environments using environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Built robust error handling and logging throughout application layers
- **Security Measures**: 
  - Implemented input validation and sanitization
  - Protected against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
  - Secured API endpoints with proper authentication

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: PDF Generation
**Problem**: Needed to generate professional, customizable PDF invoices that matched web preview.
**Solution**: Created reusable HTML templates combined with html-pdf library, implementing custom styling to ensure consistent rendering across formats. Added functionality to preview PDFs before sending.

### Challenge 2: Payment Tracking
**Problem**: Supporting partial payments and maintaining accurate payment status.
**Solution**: Developed a transaction-based payment system that tracks individual payments against invoice totals, automatically calculating remaining balances and updating status (paid, partial, overdue).

### Challenge 3: State Management
**Problem**: Managing complex application state across multiple components.
**Solution**: Implemented Redux with a normalized store structure, separating concerns with middleware for async operations, and creating selectors for efficient data access patterns.

### Challenge 4: Email Delivery
**Problem**: Ensuring reliable email delivery for invoice notifications.
**Solution**: Integrated Nodemailer with configurable SMTP settings, implemented email templates, and built a queuing system with retry logic for failed delivery attempts.
